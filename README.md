## Overview

<a href="#">Kaleidoscope for macOS</a> is aimed at people who need to compare files and directories with confidence, whether they are reviewing code, content or configuration. Side-by-side and inline views highlight additions, deletions and moved blocks in a way that respects structure instead of just raw text. Directory comparisons reveal differences in file trees, making it easier to audit project changes, validate deployments or detect stray edits. Image diffing modes round out the toolkit for designers and visual teams.

Integrations with common version control tools and editors make Kaleidoscope feel like an extension of existing workflows. It can act as an external diff and merge tool, providing a richer UI than built-in options. With <a href="#">syntax-aware highlighting</a>, context lines and filters, reviewers can focus on the changes that matter instead of being distracted by noise. Merge assistance helps resolve conflicts carefully, giving clear visibility into local, remote and base versions before decisions are made.

On macOS, Kaleidoscope leans into platform conventions: smooth scrolling, crisp rendering and reliable drag-and-drop support. Users can drag in files, folders or even text snippets directly from other apps to compare them in seconds. Over time, it becomes the place to answer questions like “what really changed?”, “why is this config different?” or “how has this design evolved?” without hunting through raw diffs in a terminal.
